# CSL Map browser
An app for browsing all available maps in the game Cities: Skylines, showcasing
their data such as buildable area percentage, the amount of resources etc. <br>
**All data is taken from an already existing website [Skylines Country](https://skylines.country)**. I am creating
this app because the mentioned website is very hard to read and is unresponsive.
