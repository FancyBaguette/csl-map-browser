# ðŸ—º Skylines Atlas
**âš  WORK IN PROGRESS âš **

An app for browsing all available maps in the game Cities: Skylines<br>
Check stuff like:
- Milestone population requirements
- Transportation info (incoming and outgoing connections)
- Resources availability
- Probabilities of atmospheric events 
- Map temperature ranges
- Map views (screenshots showcasing many map features like topography etc.)

**All data is taken from an already existing website called [Skylines Country](https://skylines.country)**

I'm creating
this app because the mentioned website is very hard to read and is unresponsive. My goal with this app is to essentially create
more accessible and more comfortable to use version of that website.
